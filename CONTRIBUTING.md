## Publishing

Creating a pre-release (ie. `v2.0.5-beta.1`) will publish packages to npm under the `next` tag. Creating a new release (ie. `v2.0.5`) will publish all packages, examples and documentation.

To publish a new release:

1.  Create a new [Github release](https://github.com/mirainc/mira-kit/releases).
2.  Name the release with the new version (eg. `v2.1.0`). For pre-releases append `-<name>` to the tag (ie. `v2.1.0-beta.0`).
3.  Fetch the latest tags with `git fetch`
4.  Checkout the latest version of `master`.
5.  Generate a changelog locally with `GITHUB_AUTH=<token> yarn changelog`. You will need to [generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with a `repo` scope if you don't have one.
6.  Paste the change log into the release notes.
